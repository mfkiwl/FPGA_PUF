## UART
&nbsp;&nbsp;We have implemented a UART Controller that can be customized with parameters. Its main files are `uart_tx.v` & `uart_rx.v` & `uart_controller.v`. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also test our UART Controller using `uart_test.v`, which instantiate `uart_controller` and `FIFO`. The illustration is as follows.
